# DiffusionBee Tauri Port - User Stories (MVP)

This document outlines the user stories for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the DiffusionBee Tauri port.

## Development Status

### Current Focus: Story #4 - Generation Progress
**Status**: Starting  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Progress Update (Latest):**
- ‚úÖ Story #1 completed - Basic Text-to-Image Generation foundation
- ‚úÖ Story #2 completed - Image Generation Parameters with dimension controls
- ‚úÖ Story #3 completed - Advanced Generation Controls with sliders
- ‚úÖ Modern dark theme with glassmorphism effects implemented
- ‚úÖ Settings persistence between sessions working
- ‚úÖ Dimension validation and aspect ratio presets
- ‚úÖ Advanced controls with quality indicators and parameter summary
- ‚úÖ Tauri + Svelte setup with working application
- ‚úÖ Rust backend structure with Python integration framework
- ‚úÖ Svelte stores for state management
- ‚úÖ ImageGenerator component with UI
- ‚úÖ Basic error handling and progress tracking
- üîÑ Starting Story #4 - Generation Progress
- ‚è≥ File system operations for image storage
- ‚è≥ Real progress tracking from Python backend

**Lessons Learned from Story #1:**
- Tauri 2.0 doesn't support `shell-execute` or `shell-open` features - use standard `std::process` instead
- Error handling must match function return types (String vs custom error types)
- TypeScript stores work well with Svelte 5.0 for state management
- Component structure should be modular and reusable
- Build validation with `bun run tauri dev` is essential before committing

**Latest Achievement (Latest Commit):**
- Successfully completed Story #1 foundation
- Application runs and accepts user input
- Ready to implement Story #2: Image Generation Parameters
